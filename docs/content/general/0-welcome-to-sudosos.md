## What is SudoSOS?

SudoSOS (pronounced "sudo-sos") is a Point of Sale (POS) and financial management system for Study Association GEWIS. The system has an interesting history: it evolved from a physical "schandpaal" (wall of shame) that displayed members with outstanding debts at borrels. The original SOS _(Schandpaal Onderhoud Systeem)_ digitized this concept, followed by SuSOS _(Super Schandpaal Onderhoud Systeem)_, and now SudoSOS.

Today, SudoSOS handles everything from quick drink purchases at borrels to complex financial operations like invoicing, balance management, and payment processing.

## Problems SudoSOS Solves

GEWIS needed a tailored point of sale and financial management system with requirements specific to how the association operates. While many POS solutions exist, a crucial need for GEWIS was seamless integration with the unique structure of the association, using our existing member database, organizational hierarchies, and custom data, rather than forcing our workflows into a generic template. In particular, the system had to:

- Process transactions quickly at borrels and activities
- Enable self-service checkouts where members purchase items independently  
- Track member balances and spending
- Generate invoices for outstanding debts
- Handle deposits and payments
- Provide financial oversight and reporting
- Manage multiple points of sale and product catalogues
- Integrate with external systems for member data and organisational structure
- Seamlessly connect with GEWISâ€™s existing infrastructure

SudoSOS provides a complete solution for these diverse needs, combining sransaction processing with financial oversight and deep integration with GEWISâ€™s systems.

## System Components

To deliver this  solution, the SudoSOS ecosystem consists of:

- **Backend API** (this repository) - RESTful API, business logic, database management, and external integrations
- **Frontend Applications** (sudosos-frontend repository) - Dashboard for management and POS interface for self-service checkouts
- **External Integrations** - GEWISDB, LDAP/Active Directory, Stripe payments, and email service

These components work together to provide a complete solution for GEWIS's financial and point-of-sale needs. The backend API handles all business logic and data management, while the frontend applications provide user interfaces for different use cases.

::: tip Looking for Frontend Code?
The frontend applications (Dashboard and POS Interface) are developed in a separate repository: **[sudosos-frontend](https://github.com/GEWIS/sudosos-frontend)**. This documentation covers only the backend API.
