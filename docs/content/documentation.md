# Documentation

This section is the **generated reference** for SudoSOS Back-end, built from TypeDoc.

If you are new to the domain, start with the General docs:
- **[Overview](/general/0-overview)**
- **[Core Concepts](/general/1-core-concepts)**

## How this reference is organised

- **Documentation (external)**: modules that are useful to API consumers and frontend/client developers.

  Use this together with Swagger for request/response shapes.
- **Internals (backend-only)**: helpers and internal modules that are mainly useful when changing the backend implementation.

## API reference (Swagger)

- Production: `https://sudosos.gewis.nl/api/api-docs/`
- Local development: `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`
