/**
 * The NFC Authenticator is used for Near Field Communication (NFC) card-based authentication.
 * This authentication method allows users to authenticate using physical NFC cards or tags
 * by simply tapping them against an NFC reader.
 *
 * NFC Authentication is a _direct authentication method_. Unlike hash-based methods, the
 * NFC code (UID) is stored directly in the database and compared against the scanned value.
 * This provides fast authentication suitable for point-of-sale scenarios.
 *
 * ## NFC Authentication Flow
 * 1. **User** taps their NFC card against an NFC reader.
 * 2. **Reader** captures the NFC UID and sends it to `/authentication/nfc`.
 * 3. **Authentication Controller** looks up the NfcAuthenticator by the provided UID.
 * 4. **Authentication Controller** retrieves the associated user.
 * 5. **Authentication Controller** returns a JWT token if the NFC code is valid.
 *
 * ## Security Considerations
 * - NFC codes are stored in plain text (not hashed) for fast lookup
 * - NFC authentication returns a "lesser" JWT token to limit access scope
 * - Physical possession of the NFC card is required for authentication
 *
 * @typedef {AuthenticationMethod} NfcAuthenticator
 * @property {string} nfcCode.required - The unique identifier (UID) of the NFC chip
