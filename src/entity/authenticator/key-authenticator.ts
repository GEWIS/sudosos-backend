/**
 * The Key Authenticator is used for API key-based authentication in SudoSOS.
 * This authentication method allows programmatic access to the system using
 * pre-generated API keys instead of user credentials.
 *
 * Key Authentication is a _hash-based authentication method_. This means that the
 * API key is hashed using bcrypt and stored in the database, and later compared
 * against the input during authentication attempts.
 *
 * ## Key Authentication Flow
 * 1. **Client** sends a request to the `/authentication/key` endpoint with user ID and API key.
 * 2. **Authentication Controller** looks up the user by ID.
 * 3. **Authentication Controller** retrieves the associated KeyAuthenticator.
 * 4. **Authentication Service** compares the provided key against the stored hash.
 * 5. **Authentication Controller** returns a JWT token if authentication succeeds.
 *
 * ## Use Cases
 * - Automated systems that need to access the SudoSOS API
 * - Third-party integrations
 * - Scripts and tools that require programmatic access
 * - Testing and development environments
 *
 * @typedef {HashBasedAuthenticationMethod} KeyAuthenticator
 * @property {string} hash.required - The API key of this user (hashed using bcrypt)
