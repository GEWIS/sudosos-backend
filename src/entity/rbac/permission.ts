/**
 * The Permission entity represents a specific permission within the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.
 * Permissions define what actions a role can perform on specific entities and attributes, with
 * granular control over ownership relations and access scopes.
 *
 * ## Permission Structure
 * Each permission consists of four key components:
 * - **Entity**: The type of resource being accessed (e.g., 'User', 'Product', 'Transaction')
 * - **Action**: The operation being performed (e.g., 'create', 'read', 'update', 'delete')
 * - **Relation**: The ownership relationship (e.g., 'own', 'created', 'all', 'organ')
 * - **Attributes**: Specific fields or properties that can be accessed (e.g., ['name', 'email'] or ['*'])
 *
 * ## Permission Examples
 * - `entity: 'User', action: 'read', relation: 'own', attributes: ['*']` - Can read all own user data
 * - `entity: 'Product', action: 'create', relation: 'all', attributes: ['name', 'price']` - Can create products with name and price
 * - `entity: 'Transaction', action: 'update', relation: 'organ', attributes: ['status']` - Can update transaction status for organ
 *
 * ## Attribute Wildcards
 * The special attribute '*' grants access to all attributes of the entity, providing full access
 * to all properties regardless of the specific attribute list.
 *
 * ## Database Design
 * The permission uses a composite primary key consisting of roleId, action, relation, and entity,
 * ensuring that each role can have only one permission per unique combination of these fields.
 * The attributes are stored as a JSON array in the database.
 *
 * ## Integration with Role Manager
 * Permissions are evaluated by the RoleManager's `can()` method, which checks if a user's roles
 * have the necessary permissions to perform a specific action on an entity with given attributes.
