/**
 * The AssignedRole entity represents the many-to-many relationship between users and roles
 * in the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. This entity allows individual users
 * to be assigned specific roles, granting them the permissions associated with those roles.
 *
 * ## Purpose and Usage
 * While the RBAC system primarily uses user types for automatic role assignment (via RoleUserType),
 * AssignedRole provides explicit role assignment for individual users. This is useful for:
 * - **Custom Role Assignments**: Granting specific roles to individual users
 * - **Testing**: Assigning roles for testing purposes
 * - **Legacy Support**: Maintaining compatibility with existing role assignment systems
 * - **Administrative Overrides**: Manually assigning roles that differ from user type defaults
 *
 * ## Relationship Model
 * - **User**: Each assignment is linked to a specific user
 * - **Role**: Each assignment grants a specific role to the user
 * - **Composite Key**: The combination of userId and roleId forms a unique constraint
 *
 * ## Role Assignment Hierarchy
 * Users can receive roles through multiple mechanisms:
 * 1. **User Type Assignment**: Automatic roles based on user type (RoleUserType)
 * 2. **Individual Assignment**: Explicit role assignment (AssignedRole)
 * 3. **Organ Membership**: Additional roles through organ membership (OrganMembership)
 *
 * ## Database Design
 * The entity uses a composite primary key (userId, roleId) to ensure that each user
 * can only have one instance of each role. The relationship includes cascade delete
 * behavior to maintain referential integrity.
 *
 * ## Integration with Role Manager
 * The RoleManager's `getRoles()` method considers both user type assignments and
 * individual role assignments when determining a user's effective roles.
