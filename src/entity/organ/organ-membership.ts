/**
 * The OrganMembership entity tracks user membership in organs (shared accounts).
 * 
 * **Purpose:**
 * - Tracks which users are members of organs (UserType.ORGAN)
 * - Used for RBAC permission checks (determining 'organ' vs 'own' vs 'all' relations)
 * - Populates the JWT token's `organs` field
 * - Powers `userTokenInOrgan()` helper and `areInSameOrgan()` checks
 * 
 * @typedef {BaseEntityWithoutId} OrganMembership
 * @property {User.model} user.required - The user who is a member of the organ
 * @property {User.model} organ.required - The organ (shared account) that the user is a member of
 *
